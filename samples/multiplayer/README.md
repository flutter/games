A sample project based on the
[`card` template](https://github.com/flutter/games/tree/main/templates/card)
that adds multiplayer functionality through Firebase's
[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

Read about adding multiplayer to your mobile game
in this cookbook recipe:

https://flutter.dev/cookbook/games/firestore-multiplayer/

**Warning:** This sample will only work for you _after_ you install
Firestore and run `flutterfire configure`. 
Please do read the cookbook recipe above.


## How to get this sample

You can clone this whole repository and find this sample in your local copy.

For convenience, though, we also provide a command line tool that downloads
just the project you want.

On the command line, while having the
[Flutter SDK installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install),
run the following command:

```shell
dart pub global activate sample_downloader
```

Then, from any directory, run the newly installed tool
and follow its instructions.

```shell
sample_downloader
```
