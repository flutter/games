## How to get this sample

You can clone this whole repository and find this sample in your local copy.

For convenience, though, we also provide a command line tool that downloads
just the project you want.

On the command line, while having the
[Flutter SDK installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install),
run the following command:

```shell
dart pub global activate sample_downloader
```

Then, from any directory, run the newly installed tool
and follow its instructions.

```shell
sample_downloader
```
