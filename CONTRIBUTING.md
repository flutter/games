# Contributing

_See also: [Flutter's code of conduct](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)_

Want to contribute to the Flutter games sample ecosystem? Great! First, read this
page (including the small print at the end).

## Is this the right place for your contribution?

This repo is used by members of the Flutter team and a few partners as a place
to store example games and game templates. It's not meant to be the one and only
source of truth for Flutter game samples or the only place people go to learn
about the best ways to build games with Flutter. What that means in practice 
is that if you've written a great example game, it doesn't need to be maintained
here in order to get noticed, be of help to new Flutter devs, and have an impact
on the community.

You can maintain your sample app in your own repo (or with another source
control provider) and still be as important a part of the Flutter-verse as
anything you see here. You can let us know on the
[FlutterDev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-dev)
when you've published something and post about it with the
`#FlutterDev` hashtag.

## So what should be contributed here, then?

Fixes and necessary improvements to the existing samples, mostly.

## Before you contribute

### File an issue first!

If you see a bug or have an idea for a feature that you feel would improve one
of the samples already in the repo, **please
[file an issue](https://github.com/flutter/games/issues/new) before you begin
coding or send a PR**. This will help prevent duplicate work by letting us know
what you're up to. It will help avoid a situation in which you spend a lot of
time coding something that's not quite right for the repo or its goals.

### Sign the license agreement.

Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

## A few ground rules

This is a monorepo containing a bunch of projects. While different codebases have
different needs, there are a few basic conventions that every project here is
expected to follow. All of them are based on our experience over the last
couple years keeping similar repos tidy and running smooth.

Each app should:

* Be designed to build against the current
  [stable](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels)
  release of the Flutter SDK.
* Include the top level
  [`analysis_options.yaml`](analysis_options.yaml)
  file used throughout the repo. This file include a base set of analyzer
  conventions and lints.
* Have no analyzer errors or warnings.
* Be formatted with `dart format`.
* Include at least one working test in its `test` folder.
* Be wired into the list of projects in the CI scripts for [stable](tool/flutter_ci_script_stable.sh), 
  [beta](tool/flutter_ci_script_beta.sh), and [master](tool/flutter_ci_script_master.sh), 
  which runs the analyzer, the formatter, and `flutter test`.
* Add the new project directory to the [dependabot](.github/dependabot.yaml) configuration
  to keep dependencies updated in an on-going basis.
* Avoid adding an onerous amount of blobs (typically images or other assets) to
  the repo.

In addition, sample code is, at the end of the day, still code. It should be
written with at least as much care as the Flutter code you'd find in the SDK
itself. For that reason, most of the
[Flutter style guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo)
also applies to code in this repo.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.

This repo is part of the [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter) GitHub account,
which means that a lot of folks have the ability to push and merge code. The
primary maintainers, though, are:

* [@filiph](https://github.com/filiph)
* [@domesticmouse](https://github.com/domesticmouse)

You are free to add one of these folks as a reviewer
to any PR sent to this repo. We're happy to comment, answer (or ask) questions,
and provide feedback.

If you're part of a team that's already landed a sample in the repo, 
and you're updating or fixing that sample, you are *not* expected to
wait on one of the above folks before merging the code. Have it reviewed by
someone you trust on your own team, and then merge it.

However, if you're adding a new sample, updating a sample you've never worked on
before, or changing something that's a meta-concern like the CI setup, web
hosting, project setup, etc., please include one of the primary maintainers as a
reviewer.
