## Organization

The projects in this repository are divided into two broad categories:

1. **Templates.** A small number of starting points for your game project.
   Templates are intended to give you a simple project structure
   on top of which you can build your game.
   They differ to accommodate different game types, 
   from the simplest casual games through drag&drop board games
   to 2D platformers.

2. **Samples.** Intended to show functionality beyond the basics,
   such as multiplayer or ads integration.
